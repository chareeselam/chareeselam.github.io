								Students will create a “book,” assembling a collection of texts from their previous work into a cohesive whole⁠—responding via their curation/​selections, in writing, and with their design itself.	
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The goal of this project is to apply the skills you have now developed across multiple web pages⁠—creating your first website. This “book” will include a homepage (its cover), navigation (table of contents), individual pages for each text (chapters), and your introduction (a colophon). It will house your texts and allow a reader to move between them all. The final website will be responsive for mobile and desktop across all the pages.

								Students will work together⁠—with a new reading from those selected by the class in Manuscript⁠⁠—to express a text deliberately and consistently across devices.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The goal of this project is twofold: both an effective collaboration between partners and also a successful, responsive design. Each duo will sketch cooperatively and then implement a joint execution together, via pair programming. The final web page will be responsive for mobile, desktop, and print layouts.

								Students will choose a seminal design text from readings.design, read and respond to it, and typeset their selection and reply together.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The goal of this project is to hone your basic skills in typography, focusing on expression, hierarchy, and form appropriate to a work. You will do this through exploration, trial and error, and responding to critical feedback. And then you will execute this typesetting in code, as a web page.
